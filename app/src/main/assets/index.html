<h1>Welcome to the WebServer sample!</h1>
<p>If you have directory listing enabled, check out <a href="/assets/folder">folder</a> to check, if it is working!</p>
<p>Additionally, you can also check out the basic <a href="/assets/test.txt">test file</a> as test files are awesome.</p>
<hr>
<p>
    You may wonder why the url of the linked files and this file differs.<br/>That is pretty easy, the sample uses a router
    to link handlers to specific routes.<br/>The <i>/assets/</i> path is linked to a <b>StaticAssetHandler</b>, which serves files
    from the assets directory of the phone, while <i>/</i> and <i>/index.html</i> are statically linked to the assets/index.html
    file of the phone.
